# fu27soma-pa

# 1. Installation
After a clean installation of Proxmox on a host machine, SSH into it and run the following code block.

```
apt update -y
apt upgrade -y
apt install git -y
apt install sshpass -y
cd -L
git clone https://github.com/saracoglumert/fu27soma-pa.git
cd fu27soma-pa
chmod +x manage.py
```

This will clone the repository to your machine, install the dependencies required for the **manage script** to work and make it an executable. After that, **manage script** can be used to interact with Proxmox and the host machine.

Before starting to build the project, **config.yaml** file must be set according to your network configuration. You **have to** set *host/network_gateway*, *node1/network_ip* and *node2/network_ip* values in a way suitable for your network infrastructure, otherwise the build will fail. **manage script** can you help you with this aswell. Run the script with the following argument and you will see suggestions. Other key values are still open for change, but not mandatory.

```
./manage.py config
```

After editing the **config.yaml** file, run the following command to build the nodes and get them running. The build may take between 15 to 30 minutes depending on your internet connection.
```
./manage.py build
```

Other possible commands are,
```
./manage.py start
./manage.py stop
./manage.py destroy
./manage.py help
```

# To New aca-py Version
https://ldej.nl/post/becoming-a-hyperledger-aries-developer-part-3-connecting-using-didcomm-exchange/
Basically, the /connections/create-invitation and /connections/receive-invitation endpoints have been replaced with the Out-of-Band endpoints /out-of-band/create-invitation and /out-of-band/receive-invitation. Similarly, the /connections/{conn_id}/accept-invitation and /connections/{conn_id}/accept-request endpoints have been replaced with the DID Exchange endpoints /didexchange/{conn_id}/accept-invitation and /didexchange/{conn_id}/accept-request. This makes that the other /connections endpoints are just there to manage connections.
